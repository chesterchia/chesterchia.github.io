        <p>This is Liverpool. Liverpool is a city and metropolitan borough located in Merseyside, England. It is the
            home of Liverpool Football Club. I have been playing football since I was 5, and have been actively playing
            while also watching and supporting Liverpool since then. I was fortunate enough to
            visit Liverpool in 2018, where I took in the amazing seaside views of the port city and attended a football
            match at Liverpool FC's stadium, Anfield. I have been longing to go back ever since.</p>

        <p>One of my hobbies include building keyboards! I currently own 3 myself (none of which are in this carousel as
            I do not have the required photography experience to take such shots), and have been building keyboards for friends for 3 years now! There are many components to building a keyboard, which is exactly what I enjoy most - the customizability. From the case to the switches, keycaps to stabilizers, there are so many parts to a keyboard that can be customized to your preferred sound, feel, and look, the possibilities are simply endless! It is however, quite an expensive hobby, so I hope prof can grade me well for my website so that I can do well for this mod and get a well-paying job upon graduation to sustain this hobby.</p>

        <p>This is a song by one of the greatest pianists and composers of all time, Claude Debussy. <i>Clair De Lune</i> is french for "moonlight", and it is my favorite piano song. I have been playing the piano since kindergarten and have only managed to learn it 2 years ago, as it is a relatively difficult piece to master due to the amount of emotion and thus improvisational technique that has to be executed while playing it.</p>
