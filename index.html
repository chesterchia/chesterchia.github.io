        <p>This is me! I enjoy watching and playing football - I've been interested in the sport since I was in kindergarten!</p>
        <p>I also enjoy building keyboards and playing the piano! I've been playing since I was 6 and am currently exploring being a piano teacher.</p>

        <p>This is Liverpool. Liverpool is a city and metropolitan borough located in Merseyside, England. It is the home of Liverpool Football Club, the club that I have supported since I was young. I was fortunate enough to visit Liverpool in 2018, where I took in the amazing seaside views of the port city and attended a football match at Liverpool FC's stadium, Anfield. I have been longing to go back ever since.</p>
